How do you approach the development problem?
this is my approach for the backend side
first, I make a box chart on paper and link it with multiple boxes with link approaches like get, post, etc.
and write dry code or function according to the condition on the line which joins one box to another box
By using this method, I can easily understand the problem and approach to solving it, how can solve it, what I need to do, and how it happens

What were the interesting aspects where you copied code from Stack Overflow?
First, when you read any development  problem, we have a basic idea of how to solve it, but when we start coding, 
sometimes ideas do not stand for industry standards so we need to 
modify and  also see a different approach which gives a better solution 

What did you learn from some very specific copy-and-paste? Mention explicitly some
of them.
If we copy-paste something it means that things are out of the box and it is always a chance to learn something new like approaches, functions, new syntax of code or most importantly some new package (npm) that we do not know. And how to use it 
I remember that when I was in the second year I did not know more about JWT and always saw that code but over time I understood the code how it works, and every concept and now I have a very good hand on it and now I do not need to see the code on any side
